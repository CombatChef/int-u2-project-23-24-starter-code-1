  <p style="border: 5px solid white; padding: 10px; background-color: gold;">70% of the 24,526 murders in 1993 were committed with firearms, and it's because they boughts guns that were given to them by others. They need to add more security when purchasing guns. For example, anyone under the age of 21 should NOT weild a gun unsupervised. There needs to be some sort of verification in order to purchase a gun. And certain types of guns should be limited for certain ages, very old people should not have access to guns. Controlling what guns go into whos hands can change millions of lives, for the better. </p>
